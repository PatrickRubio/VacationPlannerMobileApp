# My Application

# Purpose
My Application allows users to create, view, and manage vacations and excursions.  
Users can put details such as the vacation title, price, notes, and the date. They can also use our notify feature to give them a notification when it is the day of the vacation or excursion  
and they can also share those details with others as well. I learned the fundamental Android development concepts with activities, layouts, input handling, and data persistence with 
database creation too.
